This makes our application maintainable, scalable, and secure, while also providing access to a wealth of resources and community support.

## Consequences

Development of the application becomes fast.
Easy for multiple developers to work together.
Easier to Update the application.
It is Easier to Debug because we have multiple levels in the application.

Spring MVC has high complexity to develop the applications using this pattern.
